# GTFO-Partial-Data-Replacer
Scripts that allow the user to replace certain data with a single run.

Useful when the game updates and you have to regenerate datablocks, meaning loss of your edits.

Only works on datablocks generated with FullPartialData setting enabled.

Before running, create a folder named 'input' and then put desired files there (preferably all freshly generated ones from a given datablock).
